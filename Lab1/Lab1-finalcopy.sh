# Description: This program writes the full name of home directory, user name,
# The value of PATH environmental variable,the current directory path, the
# process ID, and the number of users logged in.
# The program also checks if  the user goes by certain name; if so, the program # will continue and ask the user to create a custom triangle.
# The area of the triangle will be returned and a promopt to restart will appear
