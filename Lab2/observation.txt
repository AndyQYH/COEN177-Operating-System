COEN 177 Lab2 Observations 

step 2: runs ./step2 executable from code in step 1
--- the programs threw a "segmentation fault" for using "atoi(argv[1])"
--- this is expected because no input arguments are added to the program parameters.
--- total number of input = 1 --- the name of the exe program, but we are trying to access the 2nd input(which does not exist)

step 3: runs ./step2 with parameter 3000 as delay in ms
--- there are some commands between the parent and child process that are not performed in the right order
--- we expect parent process to execute first loop then the child process executes the first loop, and continuely doing it alternatively
--- The disorder maybe due to the delay after running each loop may not be long enough or because the "/t" action takes extra time to perform
--- parent process terminates before child process

step3: runs ./step2 with parameter 500 / 5000
--- ./step 500 produces more disorder in the listing of parent process and child process
--- child process finishes before parent process
--- ./step 5000 produces almost correct listing of parent process and child process
--- child process ends before parent process\
--- decrease in time delay associated with more chance of command clusterings
--- that means parent and child doe not take turns printing all the time.
