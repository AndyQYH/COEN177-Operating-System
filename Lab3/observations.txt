step1
--- the output is a list of files that are contained in the current working directory
--- the format is a little different from "ls" as it goes by column order first
--- the result is the same as doing "ls | more" in the command line

step2
--- the writer passes the arguments on command line to the upstream in pipe
--- the reader receives it through pipe from downstream and then print the input out with specified buffer size

step6
--- there are a total of 10 threads created
--- values of i that are supposed to be passed: 0 to NTHREADS - 1 (10 - 1 = 9)
--- values of i printed out: 2, 2, 6, 7, 5, 3, 4, 8, 9
--- The first thread returns then the second, third,.... and finally the nineth.
--- no duplicated thread IDs but have duplicated iteration
--- each run has different results, the thread speed and operation finihs order are random.
